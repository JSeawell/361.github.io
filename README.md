# Immunization Database
## cs361-project

The node app will currently run on port 13130. While VPN'd into the OSU flip network, you can visit the database at the following URL: `flip1.engr.oregonstate.edu:13130`.  

To log-in to the database, consider using the username: `username`, and the password: `password`.  
This will log you in to our example user, and take you to the home page where you can view records, requests records sent, or take a survey to suggest immunzations.
